```javascript

// Create an HTTPS service listening on port 443.
// Assume pem and cert files already exist and specify their filepaths.
// Set a callback function, e.g., handleOktaHookCall(),
// that will handle requests coming in to the server.
// The remainder of the sample code in this guide will be functions called
// in sequence by the callback function.
