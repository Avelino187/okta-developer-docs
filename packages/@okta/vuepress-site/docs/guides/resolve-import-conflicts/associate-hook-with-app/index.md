title: Associate the Hook to the App
---

You now need to tell Okta that you want the hook to be invoked for imports coming in from the CSV Directory agent:

1. Go to  **Directory > Directory Integrations**
1. Select **CSV Directory**.
1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

<!-- Blocked here for now, need to have agent running on a server platform somewhere. At this point, can't see options for enabling the hook. -->
